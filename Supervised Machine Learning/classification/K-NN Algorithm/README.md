## 📌 K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Classification  
*A Supervised Machine Learning Study*

---

## 📖 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation and analysis of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)** algorithm for a **classification problem**.

K-NN is a **non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm** that classifies data points based on similarity with neighboring samples in the feature space.

### The project focuses on:
- Understanding the working principle of K-NN  
- Applying proper preprocessing and feature scaling  
- Evaluating classification performance using standard metrics

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Given a dataset with numerical features and a categorical target variable, the objective is to **predict the class label of unseen data points** using the K-NN algorithm.

Mathematically, the task can be represented as:


f:Rn→{C1​,C2,…,Ck}

Where:
- **\( n \)** is the number of input features  
- **\( C_i \)** represents class labels

## 📂 Dataset Description

- **Type:** Structured tabular data  
- **Features:** Numerical attributes  
- **Target Variable:** Categorical class label  

The dataset is suitable for **distance-based learning** and highlights the importance of **feature scaling** in K-NN.
