### 🔍 Comparative Study of Classification Algorithms

Analysis using Machine Learning Models

### 📌 Abstract

This project presents a comparative analysis of three fundamental supervised machine learning classifiers—Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes. The objective is to evaluate their performance on a real-world dataset and analyze how model assumptions, data distribution, and feature scaling affect classification accuracy. The study highlights practical challenges such as class imbalance, convergence issues, and probabilistic assumptions in classification tasks.


### 🎯 Problem Definition

Given a dataset with multiple numerical features, the goal is to predict a categorical target variable using different classification algorithms and compare their predictive performance.

Formally, the task can be defined as:

      𝑓:𝑅𝑛 → {0,1,…,𝐾}

where:

`𝑛`:n is the number of input features

`𝐾`:K is the number of target classes.


### 🔬 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1.Descriptive statistics were analyzed using `df.describe()`

2.Missing values were checked using `df.isnull()`

3.Feature distributions showed overlap among classes

4.Correlation analysis indicated that some features have weak linear separability
