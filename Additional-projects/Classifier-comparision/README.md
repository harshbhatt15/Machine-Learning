## 🔍 Comparative Study of Classification Algorithms  
*Analysis using Machine Learning Models*

---

## 📌 Abstract

This project presents a **comparative analysis** of three fundamental supervised machine learning classifiers:
- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Naive Bayes  

The objective is to evaluate their performance on a real-world dataset and analyze how **model assumptions**, **data distribution**, and **feature scaling** affect classification accuracy. The study highlights practical challenges such as **class imbalance**, **convergence issues**, and **probabilistic assumptions** commonly encountered in classification tasks.

## 🎯 Problem Definition

Given a dataset with multiple numerical features, the goal is to **predict a categorical target variable** using different classification algorithms and compare their predictive performance.

### Task Description
- **Input:** Multiple numerical features  
- **Output:** One of multiple class labels  

This is a **classification problem** where model performance is compared across different algorithms.

## 🔬 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following EDA steps were performed:
- Analyzing descriptive statistics using `df.describe()`  
- Checking missing values using `df.isnull()`  
- Observing feature distributions and class overlap  
- Performing correlation analysis to assess linear separability  

EDA helps in understanding data characteristics and selecting suitable models.
